								<h3>Choosing template</h3>
								<p>In the begining I went to <a href="https://html5up.net/"> here </a> where I chose a template to work with. At first I choose a template that did not work for this project since I have to be able to display 6 projects. I tried to make a dropdown list with all the projects in the top bar but it did not work no matter what I tried. So I decided to choose a new template. I choose a template called <a href="https://html5up.net/landed"> Landed. </a></p>
								<h3>Modifying </h3>
								<p>To edit the website I decided to use <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/"> Visual Studio Code </a> as editor and use <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.live-server"> Live Preview </a </p> from Microsoft to be able to view the websites changes in real time in the same window as I modified my code.

								</p>
								<h3>Resume</h3>
								<p>
									When I started making the resume I tried it without any specific template but I did not like how it looked. So I started Google-ing and i found this <a href="https://templateflip.com/demo/templates/material-resume/">template</a> from Walter Patterson. At first I tried to use just his way of displaying skills but I could not get it to work correctly. So I started from scratch with the resume and integrated his CSS, Java and HTML scripts into the one I was using which came out really well in the end.
								</p>
								<h3> GitHub </h3>
								
								<p>
									Here I decided to use <a href="https://desktop.github.com/">GitHub Desktop</a>  which is a application where I can Push and Pull my project and also edit it from. I begun by signing up on GitHub and made a repository for my website. When I finished downloading GitHub Desktop I signed in and opened my repository and made a folder in my file explorer where I can send files from my PC to GitHub Desktop. I uploaded my files for the site to the folder and got them into GitHub Desktop.
								</p>
								<div class="image fit"><img src="images/pic_123.JPG" ></div>
								<p>Then I pushed them all to GitHub in my repository. From there I went into Settings where I found a setting under Pages where I choose my branch and saved. </p>
								<div class="image fit"><img src="images/pic_321.JPG" ></div>
								<p>
									Then I got a link for my site and it was up and running.
